The project is a search engine to find restuarants nearby that serve halal food. The serach can be done through Zipcode. The users are allowed to leave a review about the retuarants. They can also look at pictures/list of restuarants with addresses.
The website takes zipcode as input. You can navigate through different webpages through a navigation bar which. The names of each page change color when cursor hovers it. The photos of restuarants are arranged in boxes with text showing address of each restuarant. The feedback page allows the users to submit their feedback about restuarants in an edit box.The contact us page utilizes icons for address, email and zipcode. The contact form flots on the side with inputs allowing user to send messages to the server. 
The technologies that are used are HTML and CSS.
Ideas for future improvement are,
1. When zipcode is submitted, a list of restuarants appears.
2. The users should be able to rate the restuarants on feedback page.
3. Adding Social media icons on all pages.
4. A larger photo gallery.
5. Adding a map to the contact page
6. Creating a separate page for each restuarant with the name, pics, phone, email and map location.
7. Searching restuarants by type of restuarant i.e Fine Dining, Chinese restuarants, Fast food restuarants etc.
